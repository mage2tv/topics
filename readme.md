# Mage2.tv Topics

## Vote and Discuss future and existing topics for mage2.tv

### TL;DR;
Please head over to the [issues](https://github.com/mage2tv/topics/issues) and start voting.

If there are topics you feel would be more helpful to you please vote for them here.  

You can also suggest topics that are missing by opening new issues.

### How does it work

The topics for mage2.tv are represented as issues in the tracker of this repository.  

The main purpose of this repository is to collect feedback from you.

We will not necessarily pick the topic with the highest votes next, but the feedback collected here will certainly have a big influence.

The list is very much a work in progress. In fact, I think it will never be "finished".  

Each topic will correspond to a dozen or more screencasts.  

I'll be adding new topics and also will be adding details on existing topics every once in a while.

If we think an issue has been covered completely, we will close it.  

Please feel free to open new issues for topics if you think something is missing in the list, or to open topics for existing screencasts in case you think the topic is incomplete or something is wrong.

## Voting for topics

You can vote for topics by adding :+1:, :tada: or :heart: reactions to the issue.
